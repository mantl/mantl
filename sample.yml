# `roles/` directory, or by checking the online documentation at
# docs.mantl.io.

# ROLES - after provisioning the software that's common to all hosts, we do
# specialized hosts. This configuration has two major groups: control nodes and
# worker nodes. We provision the worker nodes first so that we don't create any
# race conditions. This could happen in the Mesos components - if there are no
# worker nodes when trying to schedule control software, the deployment process
# would hang.
#
# The worker role itself has a minimal configuration, as it's designed mainly to
# run software that the Mesos leader shedules. It also forwards traffic to
# globally known ports configured through Marathon.

  # all servers, we can skip it here to speed up the deployment.

# the control nodes are necessarily more complex than the worker nodes, and have
# ZooKeeper, Mesos, and Marathon leaders. In addition, they control Vault to
# manage secrets in the cluster. These servers do not run applications by
# themselves, they only schedule work. That said, there should be at least 3 of
# them (and always an odd number) so that ZooKeeper can get and keep a quorum.
