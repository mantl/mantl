# BASICS - we need every node in the cluster to have common software running to
# increase stability and enable service discovery. You can look at the
# documentation for each of these components in their README file in the
# `roles/` directory, or by checking the online documentation at
# microservices-infrastructure.readthedocs.org.

    # components know what information to use for this values to help with

# ROLES - after provisioning the software that's common to all hosts, we do
# specialized hosts. This configuration has two major groups: control nodes and
# worker nodes. We provision the worker nodes first so that we don't create any
# race conditions. This could happen in the Mesos components - if there are no
# worker nodes when trying to schedule control software, the deployment process
# would hang.
#
# The worker role itself has a minimal configuration, as it's designed mainly to
# run software that the Mesos leader shedules. It also forwards traffic to
# globally known ports configured through Marathon.

# manage secrets in the cluster. These servers do not run applications by

# them (and always an odd number) so that ZooKeeper can get and keep a quorum.
